Each folder represents an implementation in a different programming language. Use whichever works best for you. ;-)

These scripts use a feature known as Printer Job Language (PJL: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Printer_Job_Language&oldid=328790684). Anyone interested in learning more about how they work (and/or about all the other cool things you can use PJL for) should browse HP's documentation on the subject:

In the interest of giving credit where credit is due, I originally got the idea for these scripts from http://odetocode.com/humor/68.aspx.
